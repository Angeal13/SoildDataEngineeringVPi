Required Components
Essential Hardware
Raspberry Pi 3 (with MicroSD card and OS)

NPK Soil Sensor with Modbus RTU (RS485 interface)

USB to RS485 Converter (e.g., FTDI, CH340, CP2102)

12V DC Power Supply for soil sensor (1-2A recommended)

5V DC Power Supply for Raspberry Pi (2.5A recommended)

Cables and Connectors
Jumper wires (for RS485 connections)

USB Cable (Type A to whatever your converter needs)

Ethernet Cable or WiFi connection

Power cables for both devices

Optional but Recommended
Breadboard for secure connections

Terminal blocks for professional wiring

Waterproof enclosure for outdoor deployment

Surge protector for power connections

Step-by-Step Wiring Instructions
1. Power Connections
Connect 5V power supply to Raspberry Pi MicroUSB port

Connect 12V power supply to NPK sensor:

Red wire: 12V+ to sensor VCC

Black wire: 12V- to sensor GND

2. Data Connections
Connect USB cable from Raspberry Pi to RS485 converter

Wire RS485 converter to NPK sensor:

A+ (Converter) → A+ (Sensor) - Yellow wire

B- (Converter) → B- (Sensor) - Blue wire

GND (Converter) → GND (Sensor) - Green wire

3. Network Connection
Connect Ethernet cable from Raspberry Pi to router

Ensure Raspberry Pi has internet access for database communication

4. Sensor Placement
Insert NPK sensor probes into soil at measurement location

Ensure good soil contact for accurate readings

Protect connections from moisture if outdoors
